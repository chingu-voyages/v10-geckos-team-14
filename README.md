## Overview

On-Demand Household and Personal Services Booking System developed during Chingu's Voyage 10. Chingu is a global collaboration platform that connects motivated learners who have shared goals to learn, help, and build together. â€˜Chinguâ€™ is a Korean word meaning â€˜friend.â€™  As a Chingu, you are a part of a friendly and supportive community of coders, one that has a shared goal of acquiring and refining their skills.

Chingu is a flexible & remote learning program for developers and aspiring developers who want to complete projects and gain experience. We provide deadlines, collaboration experiences, accountability tools, and a friendly community with shared goals.
