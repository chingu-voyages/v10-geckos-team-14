## Overview


On-Demand Household and Personal Services Booking System developed during Chingu's Voyage 10. Chingu is a global collaboration platform that connects motivated learners who have shared goals to learn, help, and build together. Chingu is a Korean word meaning ‘friend.’  As a Chingu, you are a part of a friendly and supportive community of coders, one that has a shared goal of acquiring and refining their skills.

Chingu is a flexible & remote learning program for developers and aspiring developers who want to complete projects and gain experience. We provide deadlines, collaboration experiences, accountability tools, and a friendly community with shared goals.

### Challenge 💪

Typically a six (6) week adventure, Chingu Voyage 10 Team #14's repository was created on July 17, 2019, fourteen (14) days after most chingu counterparts.  The target is MVP completion approximately twenty-five (25) days after repository creation.

#### Modified Schedule 📆

### Motivation

There is something motivating about being surrounded by people who are actively working towards the same goals, eager and committed to growth through learning. The opportunity to apply one's technical skills on a team project with pair programming, in a fully distributed, remote, and agile environment.  While also practicing the soft skills and team workflows necessary to thrive in a professional development environment.
